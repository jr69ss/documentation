# ElastiFlow Unified Flow Collector

Networks are the unsung heroes of the modern world in which we live. Whether for business, health, entertainment or social connection, we all depend on the reliability, performance and security of network infrastructure. ElastiFlow provides the network visibility and insights which make this world possible.

## Architecture

The ElastiFlow Unified Flow Collector receives, decodes, transforms, normalizes, translates and enriches network flow records sent from network devices and applications using IPFIX, Netflow and sFlow. The resulting records can be sent to various data platforms including Elasticsearch, Splunk and Apache Kafka.
